PetitePrince
============

Objectives 
 - To practice C# and game design in XNA
 - To understand Object Orientated Concepts (this game does not use Inheritence and Polymorphism, because they were not needed in a project of this simplicity)
 - To practice integration of XBOX-360 with XNA games.


The game, written in C# and XNA, uses different frames that move around as the user moves across the screen. The user shoots hats across the screen. The idea of the game is based on the book The Petite Prince.
